# HackAtBrown
Tensorflow. 
## Inspiration
Got inspired after attending the Tensorflow workshop by Google at Brown University.
## What it does
TensorFlow is an open source software library for machine learning in various kinds of perceptual and language understanding tasks. 
## How I built it
Used Docker to setup the envirnoment to make Tensorflow ready to run on a linux terminal. Used a simple python script to make use of Tensorflow's different modules/functions to run the right logic. 
## Challenges I ran into
Understanding Tensorflow itself was a little tricky. Getting the framework to run on Ubuntu 16.10 was hard. Basically, setting up the environment to run and modiy our AI or ML model took a lot time.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Withstanding the weather in cargo shorts and flip-flops
## What I learned
I learnt a lot about Brown's culture. Providence is a beautiful place. About the hackathon, I learnt a lot during the Tensorflow and nodeJS workshops. 
## What's next for Tensorflow Celestial Object Identifier 
developing a beautiful GUI with a much bigger ML model.
